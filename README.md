# macOS Calculator in Python

This is a simple calculator application designed to mimic the look and functionality of the macOS Calculator. It is built using Python's Tkinter library and provides basic arithmetic operations along with a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Toggle the sign of the last entered number.
- Clear the entry field with a single button press.
- Input validation to handle errors gracefully.
- Adjustable button layout and styles to resemble the macOS calculator.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Tkinter (usually included with Python standard libraries).

## Installation

1. **Download the file in Realease**
2. **Extract it**
3. **Open a Terminal window in the folder**
4. **Use this command:**

   ```bash
   python3 cal.py
   ```
5. **Voilà!**

## Usage

- Launch the application, and you will see the calculator interface.
- Use the buttons to perform calculations. 
- You can use the `C` button to clear the input.
- The `±` button toggles the sign of the last entered number.
- The application limits the input length to ensure visibility.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the appearance and functionality of the calculator. You can modify the button colors, fonts, and other settings in the `cal.py` file.
